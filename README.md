One of the largest crowd-sourced, manufacturer-independent databases of infrared remote control codes on the web, and aspiring to become the most comprehensive and most accurate one. Think of it as the "Wikipedia of infrared remote control codes".

## IR Filetype conversion

You can convert the CSV files using any of the following commands:

`npm run convert:inplace`

Converts all `*.csv` files to `*.ir` and puts them in the same directory as the csv file.

`npm run convert:dir`

Converts all `*.csv` files to `*.ir` and outputs them to the top level `ir` directory but with the same nested path from the `codes` directory.

`npm run convert:flat`

Converts all `*.csv` files to `*.ir` and outputs them to the top level `ir-flat` directory and their nested paths values up to the extension are converted to snake case. This provides a flat file structure for easy copy/paste to flipperzero devices.

`npm run convert`

Runs all of the above commands in succession.

`node index.js --file relativeToRepoRootPath/my-ir-file.csv --output relativeToRepoRootPath/`

Converts a single file and outputs it to the specified output path.

## Usage

This database contains infrared remote control codes in a very space-efficient way, using protocol, device, subdevice, function notation. Using this information, you can render signals to raw timings, Pronto Hex, or other formats using software like [IrScrutinizer](https://github.com/bengtmartensson/harctoolboxbundle) or [MakeHex](https://github.com/probonopd/MakeHex).

## Accessing

If you would like to access this database from your product (e.g., app) it is suggested that you do not bundle the database as a whole but access it dynamically at runtime. By doing so, your product will benefit from updates of the database automatically.

To access the database with any amount of traffic, it is recommended to use a content delivery network (CDN). For example, instead of accessing files from GitHub locally, you chould access them over a service like [jsdelivr.net](https://www.jsdelivr.com/) like this:

```
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/probonopd/irdb@master/codes/index
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/probonopd/irdb@master/codes/Samsung/TV/7,7.csv
```

## Contributing

1. Check whether the code you want to contribute is already in the database
2. If it is not, click the "edit" button to change/edit a file
3. Follow the naming conventions for files, `<manufacturer>/<devicetype>/<device>,<subdevice>.csv`
4. Make sure the file contains the codes in ascending order of the `function` column
5. Create a pull request and state the device you have used to create the file in the comment

## Examples

In this section, projects and products will be listed which include or access irdb.
* [irdb.tk](http://irdb.tk) website that allows you to search the database and render codes in various formats
* [IrScrutinizer](https://github.com/bengtmartensson/harctoolboxbundle) software that can import infrared remote signals from irdb, scrutinize them, and send them using various sending devices
* [DIYRemote](https://github.com/shannah/DIYRemote) Android app that allows you to browse the [irdb.tk](http://irdb.tk) website and test the IR codes live on Android devices that have an IR emitter.  Also allows you to create your own custom universal remote controls using HTML.

## License

You may include or access this database from your product (e.g., app) provided that you follow the terms of the [irdb License](https://github.com/probonopd/irdb/blob/master/LICENSE.md).
